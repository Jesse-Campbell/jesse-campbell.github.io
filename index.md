<p>
  I am currently an Undergraduate studying Mathematics at Duke Kunshan University, a dual-degree, joint venture university between Duke University (Durham, NC) and Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). However, I'll be graduating in May 2025, at which point I plan to move to the University of Florida to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics. In particular, I am interested in algebraic combinatorics and graph theory, for example, Stanley's Chromatic Symmetric Function. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science, such as discrete algorithm design.
